      </li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoon kasoori methi (or dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken
        marinade; let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time
        allows).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling,
        add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd
        the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside
        and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to
        sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the
        bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add
        ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds
        until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15
        minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep
        brown red colour.
      </li>
